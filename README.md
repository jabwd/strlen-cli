# strlen

I wanted a small command line utility that easily counts number of characters quickly without me having to open an editor and look for the way it displays it.

This utility displays the number of 'characters' in the given string, the amount of bytes needed to encode it in UTF-8 and how many elements exist in the UTF-8 collection found it the underlying string container.
